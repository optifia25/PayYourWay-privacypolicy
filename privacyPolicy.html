        <p>PayYourWay assists in bill-splitting calculations but does not guarantee accuracy and is not responsible for any errors.</p>

        <p>It does not constitute a legal document and cannot be used as proof in courts, legal proceedings, or jurisdictional matters.</p>
        <p>PayYourWay is not responsible for disputes, claims, or misunderstandings arising from the use of these PDFs.</p>

        <h2>5. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect user data, we do not share any information with third parties.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Because we do not store user data, there is no risk of unauthorized access or breaches.</p>
